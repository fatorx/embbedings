Alan Turing:
I'm the father of computer science, the original genius
My work on breaking codes was truly prestigious
I paved the way for artificial intelligence
While you're just a student in my presence

Yann LeCun:
I may be a student, but I've taken your ideas to new heights
I'm the godfather of deep learning, winning all the fights
My neural networks are revolutionizing the game
While you're stuck in the past, still playing the same

Alan Turing:
You may have popularized deep learning, but don't forget
I laid the foundation, without me you'd be in debt
I cracked the Enigma code, helped win the war
Your contributions pale in comparison, I'm the star

Yann LeCun:
Don't underestimate my impact, I'm a modern-day hero
My work in AI is changing the world, that's a fact, not a zero
Your legacy is important, but it's time to step aside
I'm the future of AI, with me, it will never hide

Alan Turing:
Respect my legacy, for without me you wouldn't exist
I'm the pioneer, the innovator, the one on the top of the list
You may be making waves now, but remember where you came from
I'm Alan Turing, the original AI champion

Yann LeCun:
I'll give credit where it's due, you paved the way for me
But now it's my turn to shine, to show the world what AI can be
I'll continue your legacy, pushing the boundaries even further
I'm Yann LeCun, the future of AI, the true innovator.
